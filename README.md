To use Sound Buddy in a group.

1) Press "Clone or Download this Repo" and locate the downloaded Sound Buddy folder on your hard drive.
Optional: Move the folder to the Desktop or a more easy to find location.

2) Find your "sound buddy". This should be someone more or less on the other side of the room.
3) Ensure that you are on the same Wi-Fi, or local area network, as your sound buddy.
4) Get the IP address of your sound buddy. This will allow you to send messages to their computer, and enabling you to trigger sounds on their machine.
5) Launch the include Pure Data patches named "Sound Buddy Sender" and "Sound Buddy Receiver".
6) Edit the Sound Buddy Sender patch to reflect your Buddy's IP address. 
7) Ask your Sound Buddy to kindly raise their volume, and for permission to trigger sounds on their computer.
8) Once all members in the group are paired off and making sounds on each other's computers, experiment with ways to organize your sound making.
